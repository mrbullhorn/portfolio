          <span class="aoeu">I've been into computers for as long as I can remember. When I finally convinced my father to buy a family computer we set it up in my room. I poured myself into that machine. Before we had the internet I would spend hours navigating the file sysetem, tweaking Windows 95 and playing games. My professional life has strayed from the computer, but now I'm coming back with a vengeance.</span>

          </div>
          <p>My professional background has most recently been as a self employed painting contractor. The challenges of running a successful painting business, while rewarding, have left me wanting more out of a career. As a musician, actor and artist I crave an element of self expression and artistic license in my work and I believe you will see that in my work.</p>

            <p>I have been a member of the theater troupe <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bikeplay/" target="_blank">Bike Play</a> for over 10 years. Each year we conceive, write, produce and put on an original piece of live theater….on bikes. Part of Portland’s Pedalpalooza bike festival, it’s consistently ranked as one of the top rides and has been the recipient of multiple awards. I write text and music and perform in the shows. I play piano and game good.</p>
